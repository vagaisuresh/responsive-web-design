          <li><span>1908</span> Enrolled in the local elementary school before being admitted to a different school. His grandfather and father died in quick succession when he was only six years old, forcing his grandmother and mother to support the family.</li>
          <li><span>1915</span> Dropped out of school and joined to work in the cloth shop run by his maternal uncle Karuppaih. He learnt the martial art silambam and boxing. Showed an interest in public happenings and politics.</li>
          <li><span>1954</span> Elected by the legislators as the leader of the party and assumed the chief minister-ship of Madras state on 13 April 1954. He brought major changes to the education system and infrastructure. The school education was made free for children up to 11 years. In order to ensure that students do not walk long distances, the educational policy formulated that schools be opened within every 3 km (1.9 mi) radius. As a result, about 6,000 schools closed previously and 12,000 new schools were added. When it was found that the enrollment was still low and the children were malnourished, he expanded the Midday Meal Scheme to all schools to provide at least one free meal per day. Free uniforms were introduced to weed out distinctions based on caste and class in schools.</li>
          <li><span>1959</span> The education system was reformed to incorporate a new syllabus and the number of working days were increased. New institutions of higher education were established including the IIT Madras.</li>

          <li><span>1964</span> After Nehru's untimely death, he successfully navigated the party through turbulent times. Despite being the president of the party, he refused to become the next prime minister himself and was instrumental in bringing to power two Prime Ministers, Lal Bahadur Shastri in 1964 and Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi in 1966. For this role, he was widely acclaimed as the "kingmaker".</li>
